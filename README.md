# flightgear-saitek
flightgear-saitek is a project for the open source flight simulator FlightGear. 
The purpose is to support all Saitek/Logitech panels in Flightgear perfectly. Currently the Saitek/Logitech 
radio panel and the Multi panel is supported.

## Status
Currently this is not part of FlightGear - it hopefully will be soon.

It already works very well in Linux and in Windows. 
In Windows, the number displays sometime work, sometime do not work. This is caused by the 
Windows 10 "enhanced power management" and X-Plane and MS FS 2020 are effected the same ways.
There is a work-around: follow the steps given here: https://github.com/pfefferFlight/flightgear-saitek/issues/2#issuecomment-832503167

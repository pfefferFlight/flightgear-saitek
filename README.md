# flightgear-saitek
flightgear-saitek is a project for the open source flight simulator FlightGear. 
The purpose is to support all Saitek/Logitech panels in Flightgear perfectly. Currently the Saitek/Logitech 
radio panel and the Multi panel is supported.

## Status
Currently this is not part of FlightGear - it hopefully will be soon.

It already works very well in Linux and sometimes also in Windows. Help is appriciated 
in order to find out what/when it works in Windows.

## How to install?
Click on the download-button above (downloading the repository), unzipp it 
and place the files and folders as described in the file "install_saitek_panels.txt"
